The `GpnN` class is designed to facilitate operations with p-adic numbers, providing a comprehensive suite of functionalities for generating p-adic numbers, performing arithmetic operations, and conducting visual analyses among other advanced mathematical operations.

## Features

- **Generate p-adic Numbers**: Dynamically create p-adic numbers within specified constraints.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on p-adic numbers.
- **Export Functionality**: Export p-adic numbers to a text file for external use.
- **Console Printing**: Print p-adic numbers to the console for inspection.
- **Visual Representations**: Generate visual representations of p-adic numbers and operations.
- **Monna Map Conversion**: Convert p-adic numbers to real numbers.
- **Parisi Matrix Calculation**: Compute and visualize the Parisi Matrix based on p-adic numbers.
- **Solving ODEs**: Utilize ordinary differential equations to analyze p-adic number dynamics.
- **GIF Animation**: Create GIF animations to visualize the behavior of p-adic numbers over time.

## Initialization

```python
from padics.GpnN import GpnN

# Initialize with a prime p, and bounds n and N
gpn = GpnN(p=5, n=-2, N=3)
